Earlier issues in this year have focused on the theme of epigenomics.
This issue starts with a review on the interplay between epigenetics and cancer genetics, which is followed by two review articles on cancer genomics.
One of the primary goals of cancer genomics is to translate its discovery to clinical practice.
Subsequent review articles provide perspectives on clinical informatics and methods on how to prioritize disease-related genes from next-generation sequencing data.
Genome-wide data should be interpreted in the context of systems biology, and the following review articles offers comprehensive information on network biology and its applications.
The next two review articles handle often overlooked but essential components of genomics, i.e., biobanks and ethical standards.
We have two additional reviews, totaling 10.
A couple of original research articles also address cancer genomics.
The remaining five articles and an application note cover a wide range of genomics and informatics.
In this issue, we have five articles in total that have been contributed from outside of Korea.
We hope that Genomics & Informatics will advance next year to become a truly international journal that is authored and read worldwide.

Abstract



		Many bioinformatics sites have managed local bio-databases, including major databases such as GenBank and PIR with update load. We have developed several programs to monitor the update status of these databases and to FTP them automatically. These programs can be used for maintaining local bio-databases as recent versions and providing up-to-date databases through FTP sites. Currently, the program serves major bio-databases and will extend to accommodate many more bio-databases.

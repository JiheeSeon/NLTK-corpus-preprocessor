Abstract



		We introduce a computational approach for analysis of glycosylation in Post-PKS tailoring steps. It is a computational method to predict the deoxysugar biosynthesis unit pathway and the substrate specificity of glycosyltransferases involved in the glycosylation of polyketides. In this work, a directed and weighted graph is introduced to represent and predict the deoxysugar biosynthesis unit pathway. In addition, a homology based gene clustering method is used to predict the substrate specificity of glycosyltransferases. It is useful for the rational design of polyketide natural products, which leads to in silico drug discovery.

Abstract



		In order to identify novel proapoptotic genes, we screened approximately 1,000 hypothetical genes whose functions are completely unknown. After these genes were transiently expressed in HeLa cells, their nuclei images were captured using automated high-speed fluorescence microscope, through which the ratio of apoptotic nuclei was estimated. We selected genes that induce greater than 3-fold increase in apoptotic nuclei compared to that of the vector control. The candidate proapoptotic genes were sequenced and their effects on cell death were further confirmed by the additional assay, DNA fragmentation ELISA. Finally, we were able to identify 4 full-length hypo-thetical genes with proapoptotic activity.

Abstract



		Histone deacetylation and demethylation are epigenetic mechanisms implicated in cancer. Studies regarding the role of modulation of gene expression utilizing the histone deacetylase inhibitor scriptaid and the demethylating agent 5-azacytidine in HL-60 leukemia cells have been limited. We studied the possibility of recovering epigenetically silenced genes by scriptaid and 5-azacytidine in human leukemia cells by DNA microarray analysis. The first group was leukemia cells that were cultured with 5-azacytidine.
The second group was cultured with scriptaid. The other group was cultured with both agents. Two hundred seventy newly developed genes were expressed after the combination of 5-azacytidine and scriptaid. Twenty-nine genes were unchanged after the combination treatment of 5-azacytidine and scriptaid. Among the 270 genes, 13 genes were differed significantly from the control. HPGD , CPA3, CEACAM6, LOC653907, ETS1, RAB37, PMP22, FST, FOXC1, and CCL2 were up-regulated, and IGLL3, IGLL1, and ASS1 were down-regulated. Eleven genes associated with oncogenesis were found among the differentially expressed genes: ETS1, ASCL2, BTG2, BTG1, SLAMF6, CDKN2D, RRAS, RET, GIPC1, MAGEB, and RGL4. We report the results of our leukemia cell microarray profiles after epigenetic combination therapy with the hope that they are the starting point of selectively targeted epigenetic therapy.

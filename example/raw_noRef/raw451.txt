Abstract



		Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common malignancies worldwide and a typical hypervascular tumor.
Therefore, it is important to find factors related to angiogenesis in the process of HCC malignancy. In order to find angiogenesis-related factors in HCC, we used combined methods of in silico prediction and an experimental assay.
We analyzed 1457 genes extracted from cDNA microarray of HCC patients by text-mining, sequence similarity search and domain analysis. As a result, we predicted that 16 genes were likely to be involved in angiogenesis and then the effects of these genes were confirmed by hypoxia response element(HRE)-luciferase assay. For instant,we classified osteopontin into a potent angiogenic factor and coagulation factor XII into a significant anti-angiogenic factor.
Collectively, we suggest that using a combination of in silico prediction and experimental approaches, we can identify HCC-specific angiogenesis-related factors effectively and rapidly.

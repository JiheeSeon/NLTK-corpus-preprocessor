Abstract



		Although much is known about the molecular biology of platelets, the megakaryocytes' (MKs) molecular biology was not understood so well because of their rareness. By the cloning and characterization of thrombopoietin (TPO), which is the principal regulator of the growth and development of the MKs, researches on the MKs have been growing rapidly. To understand megakaryocytopoiesis, we investigated the gene expression profile of the MKs using oligonucleotide microarray where 10, 108 unique genes were spotted.
Comparing the fluorescence intensities of which ratio is > or = |2|, 372 genes were up-regulated and 541 genes were down-regulated in MKs. For confirmatory expression, RNase protection assay (RPA) establishing abundant apoptotic gene expression was carried out. In MKs, many of the known genes, including several platelet related genes, GATA binding protein were highly expressed. Particularly, TGF beta, clusterin (complement lysis inhibitor), and thymosin beta 4 (actin-sequestering molecules) were expressed highly in MKs.
As MKs specific expressed genes may regulate normal and pathologic platelet (and/or MK) functions, the transcript profiling using microarray was useful on molecular understanding of MKs.

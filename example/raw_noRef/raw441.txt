Abstract



		Case-control studies are widely used for disease gene mapping using individual genotyping data. However, analyses of large samples are often impractical due to the expense of individual genotyping. The use of DNA pooling can significantly reduce the number of genotyping reactions required; hence reducing the cost of large-scale case-control association studies. Here, we discuss the design and analysis of DNA pooling genetic association studies.

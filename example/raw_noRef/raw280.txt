Abstract



		We developed an identifier mapping application for bioinformatics research in Java programming language. It is easy to use and provides many usability functionalities that are expected as essentials for a professional application.
It supports three widely used mapping services and can convert many ids from one source database into many target databases at once. Id mapping across service providers is possible by remapping the resultant ids. Because it adheres to the NetBeans platform architecture, it can be incorporated into other NetBeans platform applications as an id mapping provider without adaption or modification.

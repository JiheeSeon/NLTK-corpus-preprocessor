Abstract



		Protein kinase C (PKC) is a family of kinases involved in the transduction of cellular signals that promote lipid hydrolysis. PKC plays a pivotal role in mediating cellular responses to extracellular stimuli involved in proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. Comparative analysis of the PKC-alpha, beta, epsilon isozymes of 200 recently sequenced microbial genomes was carried out using variety of bioinformatics tools. Diversity and evolution of PKC was determined by sequence alignment. The ser/thr protein kinases of Streptomyces coelicolor A3 (2), is the only bacteria to show sequence alignment score greater than 30% with all the three PKC isotypes in the sequence alignment. S.coelicolor is the subject of our interest because it is notable for the production of pharmaceutically useful compounds including anti-tumor agents, immunosupressants and over two-thirds of all natural antibiotics currently available. The comparative analysis of three human isotypes of PKC and Serine/threonine protein kinase of S.coelicolor was carried out and possible mechanism of action of PKC was derived. Our analysis indicates that Serine/ threonine protein kinase from S.
coelicolor can be a good candidate for potent anti-tumor agent. The presence of three representative isotypes of the PKC super family in this organism helps us to understand the mechanism of PKC from evolutionary perspective.

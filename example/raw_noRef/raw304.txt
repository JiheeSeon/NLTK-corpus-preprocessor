Abstract



		Although abundant biology data have been accumulated in public biology databases, such as GenBank and PIR, few easy-interface services are provided for users to access or update them. We have developed a system, named BioStore, that is composed of several programs to aid users to not only access public data but also share their own data easily. The service can be used for maintaining a local database as a repository of raw data files of several public databases and distributing the data files to other users.
Currently, BioStore manipulates major bio-databases and will expand to include more databases and more useful interfaces.

Abstract



		T helper-type 2 cytokines, such as IL-4 and IL-13, may play a central role in allergic diseases. The protein known as signal transducers and activators of transcription 6 (STAT6) is a key transcription factor involved in both IL-4- and -13-mediated biological responses. Two polymorphisms of the STAT 6 gene (exon 1 and G2964A variant) have been found. We investigated whether these STAT6 gene polymorphisms were associated with allergic rhinitis. Blood samples for genetic analysis were obtained from 285 individuals with allergic rhinitis and from 271 healthy subjects without atopic disease. The G2964A variant of the STAT6 gene was genotyped using PCR-RFLP analysis. The GT repeat polymorphism in exon 1 of the STAT6 gene was genotyped by fragment analysis. There was no association between the 2964A variant and GT repeat polymorphism in exon 1 of the STAT6 and allergic rhinitis in a Korean population (both p > 0.05). Our results suggest that a combination of STAT6 gene polymorphisms is not a useful marker for predicting allergic rhinitis.

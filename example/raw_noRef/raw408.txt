Abstract



		Toxicogenomics combines transcriptome, proteome and metabolome profiling with conventional toxicology to investigate the interaction between biological molecules and toxicant or environmental stress in disease caution.
Toxicogenomics faces the problems of comparison and integration across different sources of data. Cause of unusual characteristics of toxicogenomic data, researcher should be assisted by data analysis and annotation for getting meaningful information. There are already existing repositories which claim to stand for toxicogenomics database. However, those just contain limited abilities for toxicogenomic research. For supporting toxicologist who comes up against toxicogenomic data flood, now we propose novel toxicogenomics knowledgebase system, XPERANTO-TOX.
XPERANTO-TOX is an integrated system for toxicogenomic data management and analysis. It is composed of three distinct but closely connected parts. Firstly, Data Storage System is for reposit many kinds of '-omics' data and conventional toxicology data. Secondly, Data Analysis System consists of analytical modules for integrated toxicogenomics data. At last, Data Annotation System is for giving extensive insight of data to researcher.

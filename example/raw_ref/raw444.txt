Abstract



		Comparative Statistic Module(CSM) provides more reliable list of significant genes to genomics researchers by offering the commonly selected genes and a method of choice by calculating the rank of each statistical test based on the average ranking of common genes across the five statistical methods, i.e. t-test, Kruskal-Wallis (Wilcoxon signed rank) test, SAM, two sample multiple test, and Empirical Bayesian test. This statistical analysis module is implemented in Perl, and R languages.

Abstract



		WebChemDB is an integrated chemical database retrieval system that provides access to over 8 million publicly available chemical structures, including related information on their biological activities and direct links to other public chemical resources, such as PubChem, ChEBI, and DrugBank. The data are publicly available over the web, using two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) structure retrieval systems with various filters and molecular descriptors. The web services API also provides researchers with functionalities to programmatically manipulate, search, and analyze the data.

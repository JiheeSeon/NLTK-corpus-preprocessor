Abstract



		RAN-aCGH is an R GUI tool for the analysis and visualization of array comparative genomic hybridization (array-CGH) experiments. The tool consists of data-loading, preprocessing for missing data, several methods for statistical identification of DNA copy number aberration, and visualization of the copy number change. RAN-aCGH requires a single input format, provides various visualizations, and allows the addition of a new statistical method, all in a user-friendly graphic user interface (GUI).

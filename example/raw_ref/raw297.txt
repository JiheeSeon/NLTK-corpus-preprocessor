Abstract



		Cell membrane proteins play crucial roles in the cell's molecular interaction with its environment and within itself. They consist of membrane-bound proteins and many types of transmembrane (TM) proteins such as receptors, transporters, channel proteins, and enzymes. Membrane proteomes of cellular organisms reveal some characteristics in their global topological distribution according to their evolutionary positions, and show their own information transfer complexity. Predicted transmembrane segments (TMSs) in membrane proteomes with HMMTOP showed near power-law distribution and frequency characteristics in 6-TMS and 7-TMS proteins in prokaryotes and eukaryotes, respectively.
This reaffirms the important roles of membrane receptors in cellular communication and biological evolutionary history.

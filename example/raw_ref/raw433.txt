Abstract



		Visualization of the homology information is an important method to analyze the evolutionary and functional meanings of genes. With a database containing model genomes of Homo sapiens, Mus muculus, and Rattus norvegicus, we constructed a web-based comparative analysis tool, BioCovi, to visualize the homology information of mammalian sequences on a very large scale. The user interface has several features: it marks regions whose identity is greater than that specified, it shows or hides gaps from the result of global sequence alignment, and it inverts the graph when total identity is higher than the threshold specified.

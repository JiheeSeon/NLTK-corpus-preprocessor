Abstract



		Every protein can be characterized by either a distinct motif or a combination of motifs. Nevertheless, little is known about the relationships among (more than two) the motifs. Some of the proteins in the world are share motifs for evolutional or other biological benefits - they can save energy, time and resource for controlling and managing a variety of proteins. In some cases of motifs, the tendency is quite common and they can act the 'hub' motif of a network of the motif associations. The hubs are structurally and functionally important in themselves and also important in disease-related mutations. They will be highly resistant mutation to conserve their functions. But, in case of the a rare mutation, mutations on the position of hub can more easily cause fatal diseases.

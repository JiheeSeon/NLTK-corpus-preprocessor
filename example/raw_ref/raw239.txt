Abstract



		Most statistical methods for finding interesting genes are focusing on the summary values with large fold-changes or large variations. Very few methods consider the probe level data. We developed a new measure to detect reliability that incorporates the probe level data. This reliability measure is useful for exploring the microarray data without ignoring the probe level data. It is easy to calculate, and it can be used for all the other statistical methods as a good guideline to find real differentially expressed genes.
Instead of filtering out genes before the analysis, we use whole genes in the analysis and make decisions with new reliability measures.

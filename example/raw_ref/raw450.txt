Abstract



		Biological data and analysis tools are accumulated in distributed databases and web servers. For this reason, biologists who want to find information from the web should be aware of the various kinds of resources where it is located and how it is retrieved. Integrating the data from heterogeneous biological resources will enable biologists to discover new knowledge across the specific domain boundaries from sequences to expression, structure, and pathway. And inevitably biological databases contain noisy data. Therefore, consensus among databases will confirm the reliability of its contents. We have developed WeSAT that integrates distributed and heterogeneous biological databases and analysis tools, providing through Web Services protocols. In WeSAT, biologists are retrieved specific entries in SWISS-PROT/EMBL, PDB, and KEGG, which have annotated information about sequence, structure,and pathway.
And further analysis is carried by integrated services for example homology search and multiple alignments. WeSAT makes it possible to retrieve real time updated data and analysis from the scattered databases in a single platform through Web Services.

Abstract



		We have released five Java Application Programming Interface (API) packages for viewing three-dimensional structures of proteins from the Protein Data Bank. To this end, the user interface of an earlier version has been refactored in an object-oriented fashion, in which refactoring is the process of changing a software system to improve its internal structure, without altering the external behavior. Various GUI design and features have been provided conveniently thanks to the Model-View-Control (MVC)model, which is an architectural pattern used in software engineering. Availability: The source code and API specification can be downloaded from https://sourceforge.net/projects/j3dpsv/.

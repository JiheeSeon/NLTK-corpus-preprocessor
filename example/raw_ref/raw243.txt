Abstract



		Genome-wide association (GWA) studies are the method of choice for discovering loci associated with common diseases.
More than a thousand GWA studies have reported successful identification of statistically significant association signals in human genomes for a variety of complex diseases.
In this review, I discuss some of the issues related to the future of GWA studies and their biomedical applications.

Abstract



		For the past several years, we have built various tools for automatic construction of biopathways to help biological experts, especially in the field of agriculture. We integrated several systems for constructing web applications for analyzing biological pathway information for agricultural species, constructing optimized pathway maps.
In addition to building web applications for agricultural pathway information, we developed several stand-alone software tools, which are publicly downloadable under proper license agreements.

Abstract



		We identified differentially expressed genes in RAW264.7 cells in response to single and double ligand treatments (LPS, IFNgamma, 2MA, LPS plus IFNgamma, and LPS plus 2MA).
The majority of the regulated transcripts responded additively to dual ligand treatment. However, a significant fraction responded in a non-additive fashion. Several cytokines showing non-additive transcriptional responses to dual ligand treatment also showed non-additive protein production/secretion responses in separately performed experiments. Many of the genes with non-additive responses to LPS plus 2MA showed enhanced responses and encoded pro-inflammatory proteins. LPS plus IFNgamma appeared to induce both non-additive enhancement and non-additive attenuation of gene expression. The affected genes were associated with a variety of biological functions. These experiments reveal both dependent and independent regulatory pathways and point out the specific nature of the regulatory interactions.

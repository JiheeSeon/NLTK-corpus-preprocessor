Abstract



		BACKGROUND: MicroRNAs (miRNAs)are a class of noncoding RNAs found in various organisms such as plants and mammals.
However, most of the mRNAs regulated by miRNAs are unknown.
Furthermore, miRNA targets in genomes cannot be identified by standard sequence comparison since their complementarity to the target sequence is imperfect in general. In thi s paper, we propose a kernel-based method for the efficient prediction of miRNA targets. To help in distinguishing the false positives from potentially valid targets, we elucidate the features common in experimentally confirmed targets.

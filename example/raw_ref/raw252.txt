Abstract



		Erythrocyte traits are heritable and indirect indicators of blood diseases caused by erythrocyte, but their genetic factors are largely unknown. So we performed genome-wide association study in 8,842 Korean individuals to identify genetic factors influencing erythrocyte traits. We identified 40 associations for three erythrocyte traits at genome-wide significance levels (p<1x10-6). We compared these associated loci with those reported in genome-wide association studies of European and Japanese. Our findings include previously identified loci (HBS1L-MYB, TMPRSS6, USP49 and CCND3) in other studies and novel associations (MRDS1/OFCC1, CSDE1, NRAS and 8 other loci). For example, SNP rs4895440 of HBS1L-MYB intergenic region on chromosome 6q23.3 is one of the most associations influencing erythrocyte traits (p=8.33x10-27).

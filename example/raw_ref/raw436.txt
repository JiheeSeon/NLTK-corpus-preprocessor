Abstract



		We present BioSubroutine, an open depository server that automatically categorizes various subroutines frequently used in bioinformatics research. We processed a large bioinformatics subroutine library called Bio.pl that was the first Bioperl subroutine library built in 1995. Over 1000 subroutines were processed automatically and an HTML interface has been created. BioSubroutine can accept new subroutines and algorithms from any such subroutine library, as well as provide interactive user forms. The subroutines are stored in an SQL database for quick searching and accessing. BioSubroutine is an open access project under the BioLicense license scheme.

Abstract



		Obesity provokes many serious human diseases, including various cardiovascular diseases and diabetes. Body mass index (BMI) is a highly heritable trait that is broadly used to diagnose obesity. To identify genetic loci associated with obesity in Asians, we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of a population of Korean adults (n=6,742, age 40~60 years) and detected six BMI risk loci (TNR, FAM124B, RGS12, NFE2L3, MC4R and FTO) having p<1x10(-5). However, in the replication study, only melanocortin 4 receptor gene (MC4R) (rs9946888, p=4.58x10(-7)) was replicated with marginal significance (p<0.05) in the second cohort (n=5,102, age 40~60 years).
This study indicates that each locus associated with BMI has very weak genetic effect.

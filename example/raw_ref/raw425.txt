Abstract



		Pharmacogenomics research requires an intelligent integration of large-scale genomic and clinical data with public and private knowledge resources. We developed a web-based knowledge base for KPRN (Korea Pharmacogenomics Research Network, http://kprn.snubi. org/). Four major types of information is integrated; genetic variation, drug information, disease information, and literature annotation.
Eighteen Korean pharmacogenomics research groups in collaboration have submitted 859 genotype data sets for 91 disease-related genes. Integrative analysis and visualization of the large collection of data supported by integrated biomedical pathways and ontology resources are provided with a user-friendly interface and visualization engine empowered by Generic Genome Browser.

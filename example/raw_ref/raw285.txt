Abstract



		A few bioinformatics tools have been used to find out conserved regions as probes. We have developed a system based on a heuristic method with web interfaces to find out conserved regions against microbial genomes. The system runs in real time by using relative entropy in limited narrow regions and detecting similar regions between pair regions with local alignment. The system could be useful to find out conserved regions as genome-wide scale.

Spatial folding of the DNA double helix into a chromatin structure and their dynamic interactions within the nucleus are important for regulating gene transcription and controlling the fate of cells during development.
Regarding this issue, Dr. Tae-You Kim ’ s group(Seoul National University Hospital, Korea) has comprehensively reviewed recent knowledge about the roles of CCCTC-binding factor and cohesion in genome folding, their biological implications for gene expression, and their association with human diseases.
This information could be very useful for CRISPR/Cas9-based epigenome editing technology, which is another attractive option for future epigenome-based anticancer therapy.
There is another interesting review in this issue.
Synonymous sites are generally considered to be functionally neutral.
However, a number of contradictory findings have been reported recently.
For example, some synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms(SNPs) have a similar effect size in disease association as nonsynonymous SNPs.
Dr. Sun Shim Choi ’ s group(Kangwon National University, Korea) reviewed this story.
They introduced evidence that highly expressed genes tend to have a greater preference toward so-called optimal codons than lowly expressed genes.
There are seven original articles regarding diverse genomics and bioinformatics research and one application note in this issue.

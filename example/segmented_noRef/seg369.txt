Abstract
Radiofrequency(RF) radiation at the frequency of mobile phones has been not reported to induce cellular responses in in vitro and in vivo models.
We exposed HEI-OC1, conditionally-immortalized mouse auditory cells, to RF radiation to characterize cellular responses to 1763 MHz RF radiation.
While we could not detect any differences upon RF exposure, whole-genome expression profiling might provide the most sensitive method to find the molecular responses to RF radiation.
HEI-OC1 cells were exposed to 1763 MHz RF radiation at an average specific absorption rate(SAR) of 20 W/kg for 24 hr and harvested after 5 hr of recovery(R5), alongside sham-exposed samples(S5).
From the whole-genome profiles of mouse neurons, we selected 9 differentially-expressed genes between the S5 and R5 groups using information gain-based recursive feature elimination procedure.
Based on support vector machine(SVM), we designed a prediction model using the 9 genes to discriminate the two groups.
Our prediction model could predict the target class without any error.
From these results, we developed a prediction model using biomarkers to determine the RF radiation exposure in mouse auditory cells with perfect accuracy, which may need validation in in vivo RF-exposure models.

Abstract
MOTIVATION: Many have observed a nonlinear relationship between the signal intensity and the transcript abundance in microarray data.
The first step in analyzing the data is to normalize it properly, and this should include a correction for the nonlinearity.
The commonly used linear normalization schemes do not address this problem.

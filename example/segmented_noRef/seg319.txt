Abstract
RAS guanyl-releasing protein 3(RasGRP3), a member of the Ras subfamily of GTPases, functions as a guanosine triphosphate(GTP) /guanosine diphosphate(GDP) -regulated switch that cycles between inactive GDP- and active GTP-bound states during signal transduction.
Various growth factors enhance hepatocellular carcinoma(HCC) proliferation via activation of the Ras/Raf-1/ extracellular signal-regulated kinase(ERK) pathway, which depends on RasGRP3 activation.
We investigated the relationship between polymorphisms in RasGRP3 and progression of hepatitis B virus(HBV) -infected HCC in a Korean population.
Nineteen RasGRP3 SNPs were genotyped in 206 patients with chronic liver disease(CLD) and 86 patients with HCC.
Our results revealed that the T allele of the rs7597095 SNP and the C allele of the rs7592762 SNP increased susceptibility to HCC(OR=1.55, p=0.04 and OR=1.81~2.61, p=0.01~0.03, respectively).
Moreover, patients who possessed the haplotype(ht) 1(A-T-C-G) or diplotype(dt) 1(ht1/ht1) variations had increased susceptibility to HCC(OR=1.79 ~2.78, p=0.01~0.03).
In addition, we identified an association between haplotype1(ht1) and the age of HCC onset; the age of HCC onset are earlier in ht1 +/+ than ht1 +/- or ht1 -/-(HR=0.42~0.66, p=0.006~0.015).
Thus, our data suggest that RasGRP3 SNPs are significantly associated with an increased risk of developing HCC.

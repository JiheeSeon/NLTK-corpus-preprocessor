Abstract
To allow for a quick conversion of the proprietary sequence data from various sequencing platforms, sequence format conversion toolkits are required that can be easily integrated into workflow systems.
In this respect, a format conversion tool, as well as quality conversion tool would be the minimum requirements to integrate reads from different platforms.
We have developed the Pyrus NGS Sequencing Format Converter, a simple software toolkit which allows to convert three kinds of Next Generation Sequencing reads, into commonly used fasta or fastq formats.
The converter modules are all implemented, uniformly, in Java GUI modules that can be integrated in software applications for displaying the data content in the same format.
Keywords:
sequence format conversion; next generation sequencing

Abstract
The Hairless(HR) gene regulates the expression of several target genes as a transcriptional corepressor of nuclear receptors.
The hair follicle(HF), a small independent organ of the skin, resides in the epidermis and undergoes regenerative cycling for normal hair formation.
HF development requires many genes and signaling pathways to function properly in time and space, one of them being the HR gene.
Various mutations of the HR gene have been reported to cause the hair loss phenotype in rodents and humans.
In recent studies, it has been suggested that the HR gene is a critical player in the regulation of the hair cycle and, thus, HF development.
Furthermore, the HR gene is associated with the Wnt signaling pathway, which regulates roliferation and differentiation of cells and plays an essential role in hair and skin development.
In this review, we summarize the mutations responsible for human hair disorders and discuss the roles of the HR gene in HF development.

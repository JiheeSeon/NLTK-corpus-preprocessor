Abstract
The Korean Agricultural Culture Collection(KACC) has developed a web-based system to provide an integrated database with information updates about microbial resources.
This integrated database consists of 5 major functions and contains general information, which includes identification numbers, culture media composition, image information, DNA sequences, patent information, and general forms for ordering and depositing microorganisms.
In 2008, KACC started providing characterization information.
KACC maintains 9,801 cultures of microorganisms, including 3,296 strains of bacteria, 4,734 fungi, 784 actinomycetes, 64 yeasts, and 923 others.

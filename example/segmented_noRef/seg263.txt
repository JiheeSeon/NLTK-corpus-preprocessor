Abstract
Integrating various pathway data collections to create new biological knowledge is a challenge, for which novel computational tools play a key role.
For this purpose, we developed the Java-based conversion modules KGML2SBML and KGML2BioPAX to translate KGML(KEGG Markup Language) into a couple of common data exchange formats: SBML(Systems Biology Markup Language) and BioPAX(Biological Pathway Exchange).
We hope that our work will be beneficial for other Java developers when they extend their bioinformatics system into SBML- or BioPAX-aware analysis tools.
This is part of our ongoing effort to develop an ultimate KEGG-based pathway enrichment analysis system.

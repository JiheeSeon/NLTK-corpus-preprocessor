Abstract
To examine whether the IL-1A(-889) polymorphism associates with a risk for Alzheimer 's disease(AD) and acts interactively with the apolipoprotein(APOE) epsilon 4 in the development of AD, we performed genotype analyses of the IL-1A and the APOE of the 102 Korean AD patients and 200 Korean non-demented controls.
We failed to detect a significant difference in genotypic and allelic frequencies of IL-1A between the AD group and control group.
No overexpression of the IL-1A C/T genotype and IL-1A T allele was found when we analyzed the late-onset and early-onset patients, separately.
There was no significant genetic interaction between IL-1A polymorphism and the APOE polymorphism.
In conclusion, the IL-1A polymorphism did not contribute to the development of AD independently or interactively with the APOE epsilon4 allele in Koreans.

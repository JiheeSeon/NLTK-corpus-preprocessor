Abstract
Monofunctional biosynthetic peptidoglycan transglycosylase(MBPT) catalyzes the formation of the glycan chain in bacterial cell walls from peptidoglycan subunits: N-acetylglucosamine(NAG) and acetylmuramic acid(NAM).
Bifunctional glycosyltransferases such as the penicillin binding protein(PBP) have peptidoglycan glycosyltransferase(PGT) on their C terminal end which links together the peptidoglycan subunits while transpeptidase(TP) on the N terminal end cross-links the peptide moieties on the NAM monosaccharide of the peptide subunits to create the bacterial cell wall.
The singular function of MBPT resembles the C terminal end of PBP as it too contains and utilizes a similar PGT domain.
In this article we analyzed the infectious and non infectious protein sequences of MBPT from 31 different strains of bacteria using a variety of bioinformatic tools.
Motif analysis, dot-plot comparison, and phylogenetic analysis identified a number of significant differences between infectious and non-infectious protein sequences.
In this paper we have made an attempt to explain, analyze and discuss these differences from an evolutionary perspective.
The results of our sequence analysis may open the door for utilizing MBPT as a new target to fight a variety of infectious bacteria.

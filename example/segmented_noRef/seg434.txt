Abstract
Molecular mechanisms of biological processes are typically represented as `` pathways '' that have a graph-analogical network structure.
However, due to the diversity of topics that pathways cover, their constituent biological entities are highly diverse and the semantics is embedded implicitly.
The kinds of interactions that connect biological entities are likewise diverse.
Consequently, how to model or process pathway data is not a trivial issue.
In this review article, we give an overview of the challenges in pathway database development by taking the INOH project as an example.

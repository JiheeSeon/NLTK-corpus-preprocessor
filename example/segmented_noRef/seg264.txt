Abstract
A-kinase-anchoring proteins(AKAPs) are scaffold proteins which compartmentalize protein kinase A(PKA, cAMP-dependent protein kinase) and other enzymes to specific subcellular sites.
The spatiotemporal control of these enzymes by AKAPs is important for cellular function like cell growth and development etc.
Hence, it is important to understand the basic function of AKAPs and their functional domains.
However, diverse names, function, cellular localizations and many members of AKAPs increase difficulties when researchers search appropriate AKAPs for their experimental purpose.
Nevertheless, there was no previous AKAPs-related database regardless of their important cellular functions and difficulty of finding appropriate AKAPs.
So, we developed AKAPs database(AKAPDB), which contains their sequence information, functions and other information derived from prediction programs and other databases.
Therefore, we propose that AKAPDB can be an important tool to researchers in the related fields.
AKAPDB is available via the internet at http://plaza3.snu.ac.kr/akapdb/

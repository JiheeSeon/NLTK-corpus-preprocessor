Abstract
Genotyping Tool for Viral SEQuences(GTVseq) provides scientists with the genotype information on the viral genome sequences including HIV-1, HIV-2, HBV, HCV, HTLV-1, HTLV-2, poliovirus, enterovirus, flavivirus, Hantavirus, and rotavirus.
GTVseq produces alternative and additive genotype information for the query viral sequences based on two different, but related, scoring methods.
The genotype information produced is reported in a graphical manner for the reference genotype matches and each graphical output is linked to the detailed sequence alignments between the query and the matched reference sequences.
GTVseq also reports the potential 'repeats' and/or 'recombination' sequence region in a separated window.
GTVseq does not replace completely other well-known genotyping tools such as NCBI 's virus sequence genotyping tool(http://www.ncbi.
nlm.nih.gov/projects/genotyping/formpage.cgi), but provides additional information useful in the confirmation or for further investigation of the genotype(s) for the newly isolated viral sequences.

Abstract
The H1 histone family, member N, testis-specific(H1FNT) is exclusively expressed in the testis, and had its possible role for sperm chromatin formation.
The purpose of this study is to investigate any genetic association of H1FNT gene with male infertility, especially at the promoter region.
We examined the promoter single nucleotide polymorphisms(SNP) of H1FNT gene which is located within transcription factor binding site for its association with male infertility.
The statistical analysis showed that the -1129A> T polymorphism was present at a statistically significance in male infertility(p=0.0059 and 0.0349 for hetero and risk type, respectively).
The dual-luciferase promoter assay was performed to examine the polymorphic effect of this promoter SNP by the cloning of promoter region(1700bp fragment) into pGL3-basic vector.
In our plasmid based reporter system, there is no big difference between wild and risk type.
In conclusion, H1FNT -1129A> T promoter SNP is statistically significant with male infertility, especially with subfertile(non-azoospermia) group.
Further analysis of its functional polymorphic effect in vivo may provide the biological significance of testis-specific histone with spermatogenesis.

Abstract
The imputation of untyped SNPs enables researchers to validate association findings across SNP arrays and also enables them to test a large number of SNPs to reveal the fine structure of the association peak, facilitating interpretation of the results and the location of causal polymorphisms.
In this study, we applied the imputation method to a genomewide association study and recapitulated the previously associated gene loci of blood pressure traits in Korean cohorts.
A total of 1,827,004 SNPs were imputed by the IMPUTE program, and we conducted a genomewide association study for systolic and diastolic blood pressure.
While no SNPs passed the Bonferroni correction p-value(p=2.74x10-8 for 1,827,004 SNPs), 12 novel loci for systolic blood pressure and 16 novel loci for diastolic blood pressure were detected by imputed SNPs, with 10-5

Abstract
Protein phosphorylation at tyrosine residues is a key regulatory event that modulates insulin signal transduction.
We studied the PTPN1 gene with regard to susceptibility to Korean type 2 diabetes mellitus(T2DM) and its related quantitative traits.
A total of seven SNPs[g.36171G>A(rs941798), g.58166G>A(rs3787343), g.58208A> G(rs2909270), g.64840C> T(rs754118), g.69560C> G(rs6020612), g.69866G>A(rs718050), and g.69934T> G(rs3787343)] were selected based on frequency(> 0.05), linkage disequilibrium(LD) status, and haplotype tagging status.
We studied the seven SNPs in 483 unrelated patients with type 2 diabetes(age: 64+/-2.8 years, onset age: 56+/-8.1 years; 206 men, 277 women) and 1138 nondiabetic control subjects(age: 64+/-2.9; 516 men, 622 women).
The SNP rs941798 had protective effects against T2DM with an odds ratio of 0.726(C.I. 0.541~0.975) and p-value=0.034, but none of the remaining six SNPs was associated with T2DM.
Also, rs941798 was associated with blood pressure, HDL cholesterol, insulin sensitivity.
rs941798 also has been associated with T2DM in previous reports of Caucasian-American and Hispanic-American populations.
This is the first report that shows an association between PTPN1 and T2DM in the Korean as well as Asian population.

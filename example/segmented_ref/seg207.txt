In this issue, Dr. Jong-Il Kim 's group(Seoul National University, Korea) reports gene expression profile data in human dermal fibroblasts treated with COX inhibitors.
Some COX2-selective inhibitors inhibit cellular senescence, but other COX2-selective inhibitors and COX2 nonselective inhibitors accelerate senescence and aging.
The authors tried to figure out the underlying mechanisms by which COX inhibitors modulate senescence in the skin.
Dr. Yeun-Jun Chung 's group(The Catholic University of Korea) suggests that a variant in RUNX3 is associated with the risk of ankylosing spondylitis in Koreans.
Dr. Mana Oloomi 's group(Pasteur Institute of Iran) demonstrates a sporadic phylogenic pattern in cytolethal distending toxin-producing Escherichia coli strains.

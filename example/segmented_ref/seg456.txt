Abstract
SUMMARY: HapAnalyzer is an analysis system that provides minimum analysis methods for the SNP-based association studies.
It consists of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium(HWE) test, linkage disequilibrium(LD) computation, haplotype reconstruction, and SNP(or haplotype) -phenotype association assessment.
It is well suited to a case-control association study for the unrelated population.
Keywords:
SNP; haplotype; haplotype block; disease association

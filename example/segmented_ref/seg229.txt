Abstract
The National Agricultural Biotechnology Information Center(NABIC) constructed an agricultural biology-based infrastructure and developed a biological information-based database.
The major functions of the NABIC are focused on biotechnological developments for agricultural bioinformatics and providing a web-based service to construct bioinformatics workflows easily, such as protein function prediction and genome systems biology programs.
The NABIC has concentrated on the functional genomics of major crops, building an integrated biotechnology database for agro-biotech information that focuses on the proteomics of major agricultural resources, such as rice, Chinese cabbage, rice Ds-tagging lines, and microorganisms.

Abstract
Methylation of cytosine is a post-synthesis modification that does not affect the primary DNA sequence but greatly influences gene expression level and phenotypes of an organism.
As high-throughput sequencing of bisulfite-treated DNA is the most efficient method to identify methylated sites, several tools to map sequencing reads on a reference are available.
But tools to visualize and to interpret the methylation level of methylation sites are currently insufficient.
Herein, we present a novel tool to visualize the methylation level of CpG sites.

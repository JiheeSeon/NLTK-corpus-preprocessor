Abstract
The Gene Set network viewer(GSnet) visualizes the functional enrichment of a given gene set with a protein interaction network and is implemented as a plug-in for the Cytoscape platform.
The functional enrichment of a given gene set is calculated using a hypergeometric test based on the Gene Ontology annotation.
The protein interaction network is estimated using public data.
Set operations allow a complex protein interaction network to be decomposed into a functionally-enriched module of interest.
GSnet provides a new framework for gene set analysis by integrating a priori knowledge of a biological network with functional enrichment analysis.

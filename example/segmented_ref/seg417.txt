Abstract
Germ-line mutations of the BRCA1 gene confer an increased risk for breast and ovarian cancers.
BRCA1 in female cells is directly related with the maintenance of the inactive X chromosome(Xi).
The effect by the loss of the BRCA1 function on the X chromosome gene expression remains unclear in cancer cells.
We attempted to investigate the expression pattern of the X-linked genes by performing BRCA1 knockdown via RNA interference in the MCF 7 breast cancer cell line.
The transcriptional and translational levels of BRCA1 were decreased over 95% in the MCF 7 cells after BRCA1 knockdown.
The expression patterns of one hundred ninety X-linked genes were profiled by the X chromosome-specific cDNA arrays.
A total of seven percent of the X-linked genes(14/190) were aberrantly expressed by over 2-fold in the MCF7-BRCA1 knockdown cells, which contained two up-regulated genes(2/190, 1%) and 12 downregulated genes(12/190, 6.3%).
It is interesting that 72% of the aberrantly expressed X-linked genes were located on the Xq(10/14,) region.
Our data suggests that BRCA1 may not be important to maintain X chromosome inactivation in cancer because the BRCA1 knockdown did increase the expression of the only one percent of X-linked genes in the human breast cancer cells.

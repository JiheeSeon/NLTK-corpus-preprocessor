Abstract
Radiofrequency(RF) radiation might induce the transcription of a certain set of genes as other physical stresses like ionizing radiation and UV.
To observe transcriptional changes upon RF radiation, we exposed WI-38, human lung fibroblast cell to 1763 MHz of mobile phone RF radiation at 60 W/kg of specific absorption rate(SAR) for 24h with or without heat control.
There were no significant changes in cell numbers and morphology after exposure to RF radiation.
Using quantitative RT-PCR, we checked the expression of three heat shock protein(HSP)(HSPA1A, HSPA6 and HSP105) and seven stress-related genes(TNFRSF11B, FGF2, TGFB2, ITGA2, BRIP1, EXO1, and MCM10) in RF only and RF/HS groups of RF-exposed cells.
The expressions of three heat shock proteins and seven stress-related genes were selectively changed only in RF/HS groups.
Based on the expression of ten genes, we could classify thermal and non-thermal effect of RF-exposure, which genes can be used as biomarkers for RF radiation exposure.

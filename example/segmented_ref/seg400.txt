Abstract
With the rapid development of MS technologiesy, the demands for a more sophisticated MS interpretation algorithm haves grown as well.
We have developed a new protein fingerprinting method using a binomial distribution,(fBIND).
With the fBIND, we improved the performance accuracy of protein fingerprinting up to the maximum 49%(more than MOWSE) and 2% than(at a previous binomial distribution approach studied by of Wool et al.) as compared to the established algorithms.
Moreover, we also suggest a the statistical approach to define the significance of transcription factors and motifs in the identified proteins based on the Gene Ontology(GO).

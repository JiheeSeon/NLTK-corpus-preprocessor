Abstract
Biobank Impact Factor(BIF), which is a very effective criterion to evaluate the activity of biobanks, can be estimated by the citation information of biobanks from scientific papers.
We have developed a program, ManBIF, to investigate the citation information from PDF files in the literature.
The program manages a dictionary for expressions to represent biobanks and their resources, mines the citation information by converting PDF files to text files and searching with a dictionary, and produces a statistical report file.
It can be used as an important tool by biobanks.
Keywords:
biobank; Biobank Impact Factor Data

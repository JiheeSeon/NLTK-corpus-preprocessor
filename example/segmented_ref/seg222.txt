Abstract
DNA chips are used for experiments on genes and provide useful information that could be further analyzed.
Using the data extracted from the DNA chips to find useful patterns or information has become a very important issue.
In this paper, we explain the application developed for classifying DNA chip data using a classification method based on the Particle Swarm Optimization(PSO) algorithm.
Considering that DNA chip data is extremely large and has a fuzzy characteristic, an algorithm that imitates the ecosystem such as the PSO algorithm is suitable to be used for analyzing such data.
The application enables researchers to customize the PSO algorithm parameters and see detail results of the classification rules.
Keywords:

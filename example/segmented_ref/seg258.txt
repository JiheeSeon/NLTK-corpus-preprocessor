Abstract
The association between adiponectin concentration and obesity have been reported and genetic variations of the ADIPOQ gene are known to influence the plasmatic concentration of adiponectin.
Therefore, we investigated the effect of AIPOQ single nucleotide polymorphism(SNP) on obesity-related variables, and their modulation by dietary intakes in Korean women.
The subjects consisted of 3,217 Korean women aged 40-59 years participating in the Korean Genome Epidemiology Study(KoGES).
The general characteristics, anthropometric variables, serum blood profiles were measured.
Dietary intake was analyzed using the Food Frequency Questionnaire.
Subjects with the T allele of AIPOQ rs182052 showed significantly higher obesity-related variables such as weight(p=0.005), BMI(p<0.000), fat body mass(p=0.005), and waist-hip ratio(p=0.007) than those with the C allele.
Moreover, the rs182052 T allele was associated with an increased risk of obesity prevalence(p=0.019).
However, there were not any significant interactions observed between the genotype of ADIPOQ rs182052 and dietary intake on BMI and fat body mass.
These findings suggest that the obesity-related variables may be more dominantly affected by the genotype of ADIPOQ rs182052 than dietary intake in middle aged Korean women.

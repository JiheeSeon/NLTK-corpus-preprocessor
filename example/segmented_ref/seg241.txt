Abstract
Asthma is a chronic disease associated with airway constriction due to inflammation caused by eosinophils, mast cells, and T lymphocytes, leading to serious chronic illness in children.
The eotaxin gene family has been shown to play an important role in the pathogenesis of asthma.
We hypothesized that the distinctive variations among the four seasons in Korea may affect the expression of eotaxin polymorphisms, especially in children.
We examined the possible effects of birth season(spring, March-May; summer, June-August; fall, September-November; and winter, December-February) on the phenotype of asthma in children.
All SNP data sets of the eotaxin-2 and eotaxin-3 genes were collected from 78 asthma patients and 101 controls.
Here, we investigated the effects of birth season on the expression of eotaxin-2 and eotaxin-3 in Korean children.
Using the HAPLOTYPE procedure with the HTR method in SAS/Genetics, we showed that children born in spring and summer show significant haplotypes in both the eotaxin-2 and eotaxin-3 genes.
Thus, the expression of polymorphisms in eotaxin-2 and eotaxin-3 may vary by season.

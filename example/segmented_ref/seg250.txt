Abstract
The Ribonucleotide reductases(RNR) are essential enzymes that catalyze the conversion of nucleotides to deoxynucleotides in DNA replication and repair in all living organisms.
The RNRs operate by a free radical mechanism but differ in the composition of subunit, cofactor required and regulation by allostery.
Based on these differences the RNRs are classified into three classes-class I, class II and class III which depend on oxygen, adenosylcobalamin and S-adenosylmethionine with an iron sulfur cluster respectively for radical generation.
In this article thirty seven sequences belonging to each of the three classes of RNR were analyzed by using various tools of bioinformatics.
Phylogenetic analysis, dot-plot comparisons and motif analysis was done to identify a number of differences in the three classes of RNRs.
In this research article, we have attempted to decipher evolutionary relationship between the three classes of RNR by using bioinformatics approach.

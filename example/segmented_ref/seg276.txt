Abstract
Integrins are transmembrane receptor proteins that mediate cell-cell adhesion and cell-extracellular matrix(ECM) adhesion.
The deregulation of cell-ECM adhesion and the abnormal expression of beta1(beta1) integrins(ITGB1s) are involved in tumor development and metastasis.
In the liver, the expression of integrins and ECM proteins can be a cause of hepatocellular carcinoma(HCC) development.
We performed direct DNA sequencing of 24 individuals, and identified 23 sequence variants of ITGB1 polymorphisms.
Among these 23 variants, 7 common variants were selected based on frequencies and linkage disequilibrium, and then genotyped in a larger-scale group of subjects(n=1,103).
The genetic associations of ITGB1 polymorphisms with the clearance of HBV and HCC outcome of HBV patients were analyzed using logistic regression models and Cox relative hazard models.
Although there was no significant association observed between the polymorphisms and the HCC outcome of HBV patients, the second most common haplotype(ITGB1 haplotype-2[C-C-C-C-T-C-T]) was putatively associated with HBV clearance(OR=0.75, p=0.008 and P(corr) =0.05).
The minor allele frequency(MAF) of ITGB1 haplotype-2 of the spontaneously recovered(SR) group was significantly higher than that of the chronic carrier group(CC)(freq. = 0.248 vs. 0.199).
The information derived from this study could be valuable for understanding the genetic factors involved in the clearance of HBV.

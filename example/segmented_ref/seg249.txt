Abstract
The target of rapamycin(TOR) signaling pathway is a conserved pathway that regulates eukaryotic cell growth in response to environmental cues.
Chemical genomic approaches that profile rapamycin sensitivity of yeast deletion strains have given insights into the function of TOR signaling pathway.
In the present study, we analyzed the rapamycin sensitivity of yeast deletion library strains on synthetic medium.
As a result, we identified 130 strains that are hypersensitive or resistant to rapamycin compared with wild-type cells.
Among them, 36 genes are newly identified to be related to rapamycin sensitivity.
Moreover, we found 16 strains that show alteration in rapamycin sensitivity between complex and synthetic media.
We suggest that these genes may be involved in part of TOR signaling activities that is differentially regulated by media composition.

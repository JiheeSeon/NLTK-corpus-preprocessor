Abstract
Gene-gene interaction is a key factor for explaining missing heritability.
Many methods have been proposed to identify gene-gene interactions.
Multifactor dimensionality reduction(MDR) is a well-known method for the detection of gene-gene interactions by reduction from genotypes of single-nucleotide polymorphism combinations to a binary variable with a value of high risk or low risk.
This method has been widely expanded to own a specific objective.
Among those expansions, fuzzy-MDR uses the fuzzy set theory for the membership of high risk or low risk and increases the detection rates of gene-gene interactions.
Fuzzy-MDR is expanded by a maximum likelihood estimator as a new membership function in empirical fuzzy MDR(EFMDR).
However, EFMDR is relatively slow, because it is implemented by R script language.
Therefore, in this study, we implemented EFMDR using RCPP(c++ package) for faster executions.
Our implementation for faster EFMDR, called EMMDR-Fast, is about 800 times faster than EFMDR written by R script only.

Introduction
In genome-wide association studies, many associations between single-nucleotide polymorphisms(SNPs) and phenotypes have been successfully discovered in many studies[1].
Despite the success of association studies, a large part of heritability remains unexplained as missing heritability[2].
Gene-gene interactions, rare variants, and structural variations are pointed to as causes of missing heritability.
For the detection of gene-gene interactions, the multifactor dimensionality reduction(MDR) method has been proposed by the reduction from genotype values of an SNP combination to a binary variable having a value of “ high risk ” or “ low risk ”[3].
This method has been widely expanded for specific objectives, such as balanced accuracy for imbalanced data[4], generalized MDR for covariate adjustments and continuous phenotypes[5] for survival phenotypes[6, 7], and odds ratio-based MDR[8], etc.[9-14].
Among MDR expansions, fuzzy-MDR uses the fuzzy set theory for an adaptation of membership function for reflecting the uncertainty of “ high risk ” or “ low risk, ” and detection rate increases have been verified in many simulations[15].
Fuzzy-MDR has been expanded for covariate adjustments and continuous phenotypes[16] and maximum likelihood estimator as the membership function as empirical fuzzy MDR(EFMDR)[17].
In EFMDR, a maximum likelihood estimator for each genotype is a membership value of ‘ high risk ’ or ‘ low risk ’ for the genotype.
It has been proven that values of fuzzy balanced accuracy, based on maximum likelihood estimations, follow a chi-square distribution.
Therefore, there is no need for cross-validation of p-value calculations.
However, EFMDR is relatively slow, because it is implemented by R script only.
Methods and Results
To detect k-order interactions, MDR compares the balanced accuracy of all possible k-SNP combinations[3] and performs cross-validations.
In fuzzy-MDR[15], fuzzy membership functions are used for reflecting the uncertainty of “ high risk ” or “ low risk, ” and validation of this uncertainty has been confirmed in various simulation experiments.
In EFMDR[17], the maximum likelihood estimator of probabilities of “ case ” or “ control ” is used as the relative membership degree of “ high risk ” and “ low risk, ”.
In addition, it is proven that the fuzzy balanced accuracy of EFMDR follows a chi-square distribution and that the cross-validation scheme is omitted by this property[17].
Because of the omission of cross-validation and the simple membership function, EFMDR is faster than fuzzy-MDR, but it is still slow in detecting high-order interactions.
For fast execution of EFMDR written in R, such optimization methods as using vector calculations might be a good approach.
Instead, we used the RCPP package[18] for the implementation of faster EFMDR.
In EFMDR, for detecting the k-locus interaction of a p-SNP dataset,
(pk) SNP combinations are tested for the detection of an SNP combination with the highest fuzzy balanced accuracy.
For example, for the detection of two-locus interactions in a 1000-SNP dataset, 1000 * 999/2=499,500 combinations are tested.
This procedure—comparing fuzzy balanced accuracy values of all possible k-SNP combinations—dominates almost the total execution time.
Therefore, we implemented a function for comparisons of balanced accuracy values of all possible k-SNP combinations using RCPP package(EFMDR-Fast).
The results of the execution of EFMDR and EFMDR-Fast are in exactly the same formats.
Hence, the results of EFMDR-Fast can be visualized easily using functions in EFMDR, as shown in Fig. 1.
We confirmed that the best SNP combinations of EFMDR and EFMDR-Fast are exactly the same.
EFMDR-Fast is about 800 times faster than EFMDR.
These comparisons were performed in R, version 3.5.1 on the Windows 10 platform with a 3.20 GHz CPU and 16 GB RAM.

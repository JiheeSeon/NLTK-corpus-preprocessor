Abstract
Genome of an extreme thermophile, Thermus caldophilus GK24 has been analyzed to construct the genomic map.
The genomic DNAs encapsulated in agarose gel were digested with SspI, EcoRI, SpeI, and HpaI restriction endonucleases, and then the resulting genomic DNA fragments were analyzed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis.
Its restriction map has been constructed by analyzing sizes of the restriction fragments obtained from both complete and partial digestions.
The circular form of its genome was composed of about 1.98 Mbp and a megaplasmid.
The genomic loci for the genes of xylose isomerase, thioredoxin, tRNA-16S rRNA, 23S rRNA, L5 ribosomal protein, ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase, DNA-ligase, and Tca DNA polymerase were determined by both Southern hybridization and PCR.
